## Enviroment Variable Names

For the sake of portability (and sanity), environment variable names must consist solely of letters, digits, and the underscore ( \_ ) and must not begin with a digit. In regex-speak, the names must match the following pattern:

```re
[a-zA-Z_]+[a-zA-Z0-9_]\*
```

### Example

```yaml
PUBLIC_API_KEY=publicsecrethere
FLAGS_SECRET=secrethere
DEEP_SECRET=deepsecrethere
```
